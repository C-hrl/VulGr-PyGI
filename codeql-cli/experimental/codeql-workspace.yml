# This CodeQL workspace file is designed to be placed in
# `experimental/codeql-workspace.yml` within a CodeQL CLI distribution.
# It hides all subdirectories of `experimental` from the CLI's default pack discovery,
# even if `experimental` is discoverable.

# To detect (extractor) packs within `experimental/<subdirectory>`,
# the subdirectory must be manually provided to the CLI via
# command-line arguments or an internal environment variable.

# Suppress the default search within children of the `experimental` directory.
